This Sign-up Page has been made for Task 2 of the GDSC 2023-24 Task Round.

Project is live at:- https://gdsc-task-round-frontend-2-xi.vercel.app/

The project has been made using the Vite and React frameworks to enhance its performance and potential.
Features:-
1. Password Validation has been added
2. Responsive Design
3. Animations

**Password Validation**
At the moment there are two kinds of validation:-
1. Password cannot contain certain certain special characters like !, #. This works in real-time (implemented using State)
2. Password must contain one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit and one special character. This works upon submitting the form(Create Account button).

Both the errors appear upon typing in password field only.

**Password Match**
- If confirm password field is changed a password matcher function is run which checks whether password and confirm password fields have same value. If they do, confirm password becomes green. Else, it becomes red.

**Responsive Design**
- The page has been made responsive to accomodate a variety of devices and settings.
- To do so, I have implemented media queries and relative values.
- The site is responsive to **all** window sizes.

**Animations**
Added green tick and red cross animations triggered upon a password match and not a password match, respectively.
